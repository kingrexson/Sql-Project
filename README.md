### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to find the BMT Loss rate of the GTEPs in Air Force Basic Military Training (BMT).  
### Project Background 
  Once Trainees are recruited they enter what is call Basic Military Training or BMT. Trainees can enter BMT with either a Gareentene Air Force Job or (GTEP) or as a open code. 
Open Trainees will be put in jobs in the later part of BMT and usually there to fill hard to fill positions. GTEP trainees are assigned a job or Air Force Special Code (AFSC) 
and will continue from BMT to the next step Techical Training if the past BMT. However, not everyone which a GTEP code trainee makes it pass BMT. This is consider a BMT loss. 
This can occur in three ways. They are release form there GTEP code, become a open and are reclassed into a new Job /AFSC. They are eliminated for BMT entirely or they change AFSC 
between the time the graduated BMT and start Technical Training.
